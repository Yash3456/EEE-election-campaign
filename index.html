        <h5>Hello my dear batchmates😊,<br><br>
            Its been so long studying online without sharing any memories with your friends, I bet you are dying to meet them in offline classes. Many of you want to make new friends or want to strengthen existing friendships. <br><br>
            
            I say, there is no better way to strengthen existing friendships and create new ones than by sharing a chess board or by exchanging shuttles🏸, by passing a football⚽ or by giving a kho, by cheering when the team is up or by comforting them when the team is down.<br><br>
            
            My name is <strong>PRATHAM SANTOSH GIRI</strong> and I am willing to take the responsibility of providing you with the opportunities to make new friends and strengthen the bonds of friendship by organising various sports events in our department.<br><br>
            
            I will also be taking the responsibility of bringing the best players forward and leading our department to the top in every sports event. So please <strong>VOTE ME</strong> for the position of <strong>SPORTS SECRETARY</strong> in upcoming elections.....<br><br>
            
            I am playing chess since i was 8 years old and participated in various events and tournaments since then. I was also selected for a divisional level chess tournament. I have also played badminton for 4 continuous years on court and participated in many tournaments. Cricket 🏏 is a sport that I love and play almost everyday.<br>
            <br>
            Thank You. <br><br>Past Experince :-<br>
